# FreeBSD Community and User Questions

If you've ever had questions or were confused or unclear about the inner workings of the FreeBSD Project, its people, teams, conventions, "rules", or processes, this is an opportunity for you to ask them.

* Edit (fork) this file (README.md)
* Add your question(s) to the most relevent section
* Create a Pull Request

This list (once a sufficient number of questions have been added by you) will be used to create documentation in the Wiki, Handbook or elsewhere that covers these areas.

Please feel free to propose a new section or category if the existing ones do not suffice, eg: "Conferences".

### General

* Q: What is the difference between maintainer-feedback and maintainer-approval?
* Q: When is an Issue considered "ready" to be worked on?
* Q: Why do I need (or am I being asked) to provide QA results for my changes?
* Q: What is the meaning of the term `exp-run` appearing bugzilla?

An `exp-run` is an "**exp**erimental **run**" of a single change/patch, on the entire ports tree (to build packages), or on FreeBSD itself for all supported architectures. They are used to identify regressions in potentially high-impact changes, or for changes that can affect many ports or architectures.

In the context of Bugzilla, it means an `exp-run` has been requested or might be needed (?), has been run and passed (+), or has been run and failed (-)
