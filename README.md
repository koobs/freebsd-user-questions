# FreeBSD Community and User Questions

If you've ever had questions or were confused or unclear about the inner workings of the FreeBSD Project, its people, teams, conventions, "rules", or processes, this is an opportunity for you to ask them.

This list (once a sufficient number of questions have been added by you) will be used to create documentation in the Wiki, Handbook or elsewhere that covers these areas.

* Edit (fork) this file (README.md)
* Add your question(s) to the most relevent section
* Create a Pull Request

Please feel free to propose a new section or category if the existing ones do not suffice, eg: "Conferences".
